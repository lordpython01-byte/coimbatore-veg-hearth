  # Allow Anonymous Menu Operations

  1. Changes
    - Update RLS policies to allow anon key to perform all operations
    - This allows the admin panel to work without Supabase Auth
    - Public can still only view active/available items
    - All write operations are open (should be protected at app level)
  
  2. Security Notes
    - Admin panel access is controlled by custom authentication
    - In production, consider implementing Supabase Auth for admins
    - For now, admin operations are allowed via anon key
